# Fetch Apprenticeship Challenge 2025

## Summary  
This SwiftUI iOS app fetches a JSON feed of recipes and presents them in a clean, navigable list that expands to a corresponding detailed views. Images are downloaded and cached by a custom `ImageLoader` actor that combines in-memory and on-disk caching to keep scrolling smooth and to support basic offline use. Comprehensive unit tests cover both the `APIService` networking layer and the image pipeline, so the core logic remains reliable.

## Focus Areas  
I concentrated on building the `ImageLoader` because efficient image handling is critical to perceived performance, and I wanted to demonstrate mastery of concurrency and caching without leaning on third-party libraries. I also invested significant effort in unit tests for `APIService` and `ImageLoader`, believing that robust test coverage conveys more long-term value than additional UI flourishes. Together, these two areas ensured that the app would feel fast while remaining easy to maintain.  

## Time Spent  
The project took roughly four hours overall. I spent about an hour and a half designing and coding ImageLoader, an hour building APIService, another hour writing and refining the unit tests, and the remaining minutes on UI construction, JSON decoding, and cleanup.

## Trade-offs and Decisions  
Choosing a custom caching layer over an established library gave me fine-grained control and eliminated external dependencies, but it also meant investing more time in the core logic and less in UI polish. Because the image pipeline directly drives the appâ€™s performance and overall user experience, I prioritized implementing and testing that foundation before adding visual enhancements. 

## Weakest Part  
The user interface, while functional, lacks advanced states such as skeleton loaders, a searchbar, pull-to-refresh, or graceful empty-state messaging. With more time, I would refine those interactions and expose error feedback more clearly to end users.  

## Additional Information  
Concurrency is handled with `async/await`, and `ImageLoader` is isolated in an actor to guarantee thread safety. Tests rely on a custom `StubURLProtocol`, letting them inject any network response without touching production code. If extended, I would add UI tests, implement image prefetching, and enhance offline support, but the current code remains fully runnable and testable as delivered.
